  depends_on "rust" => :build

  # Prebuilt bottles hosted on this tap's GitHub Releases. When no bottle exists
  # for a user's macOS version / arch, Homebrew falls back to building from source
  # (that is what `depends_on "rust" => :build` is for), so the tap works from day
  # one even before bottle CI has published for every platform.
